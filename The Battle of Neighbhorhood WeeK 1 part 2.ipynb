Assignment Backgroud \nReal estate in France, a profitable investment"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In its latest study, the Meilleurtaux site compared the profitability of 7 different investments: real estate, passbook A, stocks, government bonds, money market funds, life insurance and gold. And guess what? Real estate investment has been the best performing for 20 years.\n\nIndeed, the volatility of a real estate investment is very low and its profitability remains high, in particular thanks to the leverage of credit. Rental investment is therefore a safe and profitable value. \n\nIt would even be a shame not to take advantage of it during your expatriation since you can today buy a studio or a two-room apartment in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux or Marseille by bringing up to only 20% of the value of the apartment, or even 10% under certain conditions.\n\n###  The Problem\n\nThis project aim is to  to find regions in france with a big  population and its gdp per capita.  In addition, French real estate is particularly dynamic today. The year 2019 had already broken all records and 2020 also promises to be very dynamic. In January 2020, prices for old goods were up in many cities. Paris (where the price per square meter has passed the 10 000 \u20ac mark) and Lyon (where housing prices increased by 7.7% in 2019), along with Bordeaux, remain the most expensive cities in France in real estate. In 2019, the average price per square meter in the former increased by 4.7%. It increased by 3.5% in 2018. \n\n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis projectsis for any potential investorswho would like to invest in Real Estate in France , as this project will break hightlight the best regions in france when it comes to real estate investments decisions. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
