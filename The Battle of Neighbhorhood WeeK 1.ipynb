And guess what? Real estate investment has been the\n\nbest performing for 20 years. Indeed, the volatility of a real estate investment is very low and its profitability remains\n\nhigh, in particular thanks to the leverage of credit. Rental investment is therefore a safe and profitable value.\n\nIt would even be a shame not to take advantage of it during your expatriation since you can today buy a studio or a \n\ntwo-room apartment in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux or Marseille by bringing up to only 20% of the value of the apartment, or even \n10% under certain conditions.\n\n###  The Problem\n\nThis project aim is to  to find regions in france with a big  population and its gdp per capita.  In addition, French real estate\n\nis particularly dynamic today. The year 2019 had already broken all records and 2020 also promises to be very dynamic. \n\nIn January 2020, prices for old goods were up in many cities. Paris (where the price per square meter has passed \n\nthe 10 000 \u20ac mark) and Lyon (where housing prices increased by 7.7% in 2019), along with Bordeaux, remain the most \n\nexpensive cities in France in real estate. In 2019, the average price per square meter in the former increased\n\nby 4.7%. It increased by 3.5% in 2018. \n\n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis projectsis for any potential investorswho would like to invest in Real Estate in France , as this project\n\nwill break hightlight the best regions in france when it comes to real estate investments decisions. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
